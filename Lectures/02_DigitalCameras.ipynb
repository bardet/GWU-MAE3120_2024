    "The __lens__ of our eye is a remarkable piece of __adaptive optics__. The lens is made up of unusual elongated cells that have no blood supply, but obtain nutrients from the surrounding fluids, mainly the aqueous humour that bathes the front of the lens. Waste products are removed through these fluids as well. The shape of the lens can be altered by the relaxation and contraction of the ciliary muscles surrounding it, thus enabling the eye to focus clearly on objects at widely varying distances.  This is referred to as accomodation.  Thus, accommodation relies on elasticity of the elongated cells in the lens, which makes it easier to change focal distances. As we age, the crystalline lens loses its elasticity, which results in a condition called presbyopia.  \n",

If, however, little light is available, the pixel should be able to gather as many photons as possible, that is, have a large pixel surface, and convert the photons effectively into electrons (high quantum efficiency). The less light is available, the more important low dark noise becomes.\n",

Contrast is an important factor in resolution as high contrast objects (e.g. black and white lines) are more readily resolved than low contrast objects (e.g. adjacent gray lines).

Proximity focused image intensifiers have limited resolution of max. 50lp/mm9 (= 10 $\\mu m$/line). At this value the intensifier has a contrast of 5%.\n"

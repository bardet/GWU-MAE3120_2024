    "## Introduction and Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior to the 1980s, the oscilloscope and strip-chart recorder represented the most common methods for measurement of time-varying signals. With time PC-based digital data acquisition became standard in most laboratories. By combining high-speed data acquisition cards with graphical software, it is now possible to design complex data acquisition systems with real-time data analysis and plotting features, with minimal programming. The data acquisition hardware converts analog inputs into the digital domain at the specified sampling rate, and the software manipulates and displays the desired output. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab we use Python and the NI-DAQmx API for digital data acquisition. Using the ***DAQ*** Jupyter Notebook developed for this class, instructions are issued to the data acquisition hardware, either inside the PC or external to the PC (the hardware we use in our lab is connected through the USB port). The ***DAQ*** can be configured to record data to files, change sampling parameters, and display a live output of your sampled signal. \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this tutorial is to provide you with your first experience using the ***DAQ*** notebook to perform data acquisition. You will use the ***DAQ*** to take samples and plot voltage data and to illustrate some limitations of digital data acquisition systems. \n",
    "\n",
    "To help verify that you have configured the ***DAQ*** properly before performing trials, you will learn how to use ***NI MAX*** (a software provided by National Instruments). \n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, you will experiment with digital data acquisition and some of its shortcomings. For your report you are expected to save all the data you will acquire in the lab to files and plot them in Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "___\n",
    "\n",
    "In spectral analysis the goal is to determine the frequency content of a signal. Aliasing can be a serious problem with digital data acquisition if the experimenter is not careful. Significant measurement errors called ***aliasing*** errors are possible if the waveform is not sampled at high enough frequency. To avoid aliasing, the ***sampling rate*** must be at least twice the maximum frequency of the measured signal. This restriction is called the ***Nyquist criterion***. Signal aliasing occurs when waveforms are sampled at frequencies below the Nyquist frequency. Aliased signals appear to have frequencies (and possibly even waveform *shapes*) that differ from those of the actual signal. For adequate resolution of the waveform shape, data should be sampled at a much higher frequency – typically at least five times the Nyquist frequency, if possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Digital PC-based data acquisition will not totally replace oscilloscopes, at least not in the near future. The reason is sampling frequency. The maximum sampling frequency of modern PC A/D systems is typically less than a MHz (megahertz). By comparison, a good digital oscilloscope may sample as high as several GHz (gigahertz)!\n",
    "\n",
    "The fast Fourier transform (FFT) is a computationally efficient form of the more general discrete Fourier transform (DFT), which is itself a discretized version of the even more general Fourier transform (FT). Like Fourier series analysis, FFT analysis enables us to calculate the frequency content of a signal. Fourier series analysis is useful for continuous, periodic, analog signals of known fundamental frequency. FFT analysis, on the other hand, is useful for discretely sampled (digital) data, and can be applied even if the signal is not periodic. With FFT analysis, the fundamental frequency of a periodic signal does not have to be known a priori. NumPy has built-in FFT features, which are utilized in this lab. \n",
    "\n",
    "For $N$ sampled data points at sampling frequency $f_s$, the most useful output of an FFT calculation is the frequency spectrum or amplitude spectrum, which is a plot of modified FFT amplitude versus frequency. The frequency spectrum shows the relative importance or contribution of discrete frequencies, which range from zero to $f_s\\,/\\,2$. (The factor of two is a direct result of the Nyquist criterion.) The number of discrete frequencies on the frequency spectrum plot is $N\\,/\\,2 + 1$. This is half of the number of discretely sampled data points in the original signal, plus one extra since we typically plot both extreme values – from zero Hz (DC component) to the folding frequency $f_\\textit{folding}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some useful definitions for FFTs:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $N$ is the ***total number of discrete data points*** taken. $N$ is an input parameter, chosen by the user.<br><p></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "- $f_s$ is the ***sampling frequency***, in Hz. $f_s$ is an input parameter, chosen by the user. *All other properties of the FFT, including sampling time, maximum frequency, frequency resolution, etc., are determined solely from these two inputs, $N$ and $f_s$.*<br><p></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "- $T$ is the ***total sampling time***, and is calculated as $T = N\\,/\\,f_s$. To increase the sampling time, we must either *increase* the number of data points, or *decrease* the sampling frequency (or both).<br><p></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "- $f_\\textit{folding}$ is the ***folding frequency***, also called $f_\\textit{max}$, the ***maximum frequency***. $f_\\textit{folding} = f_s\\,/\\,2$. $f_\\textit{folding}$ is the maximum frequency plotted on the frequency spectrum plot, since $f_\\textit{folding}$ is the maximum frequency at which reliable information about the signal can be calculated, due to the Nyquist criterion. The only way to increase $f_\\textit{folding}$ is to increase the sampling frequency.<br><p></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\Delta f$ is the ***frequency resolution*** or ***frequency increment*** of the frequency spectrum. $\\Delta f = 1\\,/\\,T = f_s\\,/\\,N$. On the frequency spectrum plot, amplitudes of the FFT are plotted at $N\\,/\\,2 + 1$ discrete frequencies, each separated by $\\Delta f$. In other words, the discrete values of $f$ are $0$, $\\Delta f$, $2 \\Delta f$, $3 \\Delta f$, ... , $[(N\\,/\\,2\\,– 1)] \\Delta f$. (The amplitude at exactly $f_\\textit{folding}$, i.e., at $(N\\,/\\,2) \\Delta f$, is also plotted; this results in a total of $(N\\,/\\,2) + 1$ discrete frequencies, counting both $f = 0$ and $f = f_\\textit{folding}$). The *only* way to increase the frequency resolution is to increase sampling time.<br><p></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a summary of some useful techniques and rules to remember when calculating FFTs:\n",
    "\n",
    "- To get better frequency resolution for a fixed sampling frequency, increase the number of data points.<br><p></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "- To get better frequency resolution for a fixed number of data points, decrease the sampling frequency. (But be careful here not to let $f_s$ fall below the Nyquist criterion limit).<br><p></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "- To get frequency component information at higher frequencies, increase the sampling frequency.<br><p></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "- To reduce ***leakage*** in the frequency spectrum, do one or more of the following:<br><p></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Increase the number of sampled data points $N$ (at the cost of more computer time).<br><p></p>\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - Decrease the sampling frequency $f_s$ (but do not sample at such a low frequency that the Nyquist criterion is violated).<br><p></p>\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - Multiply the time signal by a ***windowing*** function prior to taking the FFT (at the cost of throwing away a significant portion of the signal, in particular data points near the start and finish of the time trace)."

Set the cutoff frequency at the sampling frequency record this signal without aliasing. Select the value of the resistor accordingly. Note: In all these circuits, it is critical that the ground bus be connected to a physical ground, such as the black ground post of the powered breadboard with the breadboard plugged in (but turned off) to secure the ground. <br><p></p>\n",

Increase the frequency of the sine wave, doubling it every time, until you start noticing that the output amplitude decreases – the low-pass filter is doing its job. Keep increasing the frequency until the filter output amplitude is 90% attenuated – in other words, G = 0.1; the output amplitude is about 10% of the input amplitude, or 0.1V.
